                <p>Welcome all to my very first site. This site has no difference to the one developed by Tim's Berner's which you can check it out <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html" target="_blank">here.
                </a></p>
                <p>This being the very first website and comparing it to today's website i really do bvelieve in progress. An example of such an inspiring website to a developer is <a href="https://www.whatismissing.org/" target="_blank">this one</a> a one of a kind website. Looking forward at the end of the training to develop such a website.</p>

            <h2 style=" color: saddlebrown; text-decoration: line-through;">About Dennis</h2>
            <p>Dennis is a passionate programmer who's looking to dive deep into tech. Kickstarting off with webdevelopment he aims to be one of the best front-end and back-end develpoers Africa has to offer. With the knowledge and skills gained from this training it's a major milestone for me and they are playing a major. This being the very first site bit's somehow boring but i believe at the end of the 8 weeks course a good-looking rensponsive website is gonna go live.</p>
